* Need to allow comments in modules, skip them though.
  * Test with a comment that contains "module" or "export" or "import".
* Put in support for import *


Is it OK to do:
    import { gammaName: name } from gamma;
    export gammaName;

* Get builds to work
  * Just use the text plugin, and use its inlining? So that import * can be supported.
